# First-Website-portfolio-
My first ever Web Development project (a sample of portfolio website).

The HTML and CSS code provided is for a simple, responsive landing page that can be used as a starting point for a website. Here is a brief explanation of each section

HTML code:

The first line sets the document type to HTML5.
The next section enclosed in the <head> tag sets the character encoding to UTF-8, adds a title to the page, and includes a link to the CSS file.
The <body> tag contains the content of the page.
The <header> tag includes the navigation menu and hero section of the page.
The <nav> tag contains the navigation menu and the logo of the page.
The <ul> tag creates an unordered list of navigation links.
The <a> tag defines the hyperlink for each navigation item.
The <section> tag creates the hero section of the page with a background image and a content area.
The <div> tag creates a container for the hero content.
The <h1> tag defines the main heading of the hero section.
The <h3> tag defines a subheading for the hero section.
The <a> tag creates a call-to-action button in the hero section.
The <main> tag defines the main content of the page.
The <section> tag creates an about section with a background color.
The <div> tag creates a container for the about content.
The <h2> tag defines the main heading of the about section.
The <h5> tag defines a subheading for the about section.
The <p> tag defines the text content of the about section.
The <footer> tag creates a footer section with a dark background.
The <div> tag creates a container for the footer content.
The <p> tags define the text content of the footer section.
The <a> tags create social media icons in the footer section.
CSS code:

The first section uses the universal selector * to reset the margin, padding, and box-sizing properties for all elements and sets the font family to 'Josefin Sans'.
The .hero class sets the background image and styles for the hero section, including height, width, and background position.
The nav class styles the navigation menu with padding and alignment properties.
The .logo class styles the logo with color, font size, letter spacing, and cursor properties.
The span tag sets the color for a specific section of text in the logo.
The nav ul li class styles the navigation list items with display, padding, and list-style properties.
The nav ul li a class styles the navigation links with color, text decoration, font weight, and text transform properties.
The ul li a:hover class styles the navigation links when hovered over with cursor, color, and border properties.
The .btn class styles the call-to-action button with background color, text color, border properties, padding, and border radius.
The .btn:hover class styles the button when hovered over with a transform property to scale the button slightly.
The .content class styles the content area of the hero section with positioning and transform properties.
The h1 tag styles the main heading of the hero section with color and margin properties.
The h3 tag styles the subheading of the hero section with color and font size properties.
The h4 tag styles a specific section of text in the logo with color, letter spacing, and font size properties.
The .about class styles the about section with background color and padding properties.
The .about-text sets the width of the text container in the about section to 550 pixels, and adds a left margin of 600 pixels, effectively moving it to the right of the screen.
The .main applies styling to the main content area of the website. It sets the width of the main content area to 1130 pixels, with a maximum width of 95% of the container it's in.
The .footer section applies styling to the footer of the website
